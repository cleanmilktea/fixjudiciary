Repos for scripts to enable ctrl+click and add "no context" button to judgments from search.

Installation instructions:

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
2. Import the scripts in the relevant repositories separately.
   
Do step 2 above by copying and pasting each script into Tampermonkey. 

The scripts are titled:

1. Add no context button
2. Annotations button for hypothes.is addon on judiciary website
3. Enable Ctrl+Click for judiciary website
4. HKLII "clean url" button on top of page

and are located towards the top of this webpage.

To install, click the Tampermonkey extension icon in your extensions toolbar > create a new script > select existing default text and delete (ctrl+a, backspace) paste > ctrl+s (windows) or cmd+s (mac) to save.

3. Follow instructions at https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209 to enable userscripts (Q209 on the page).

4. Enjoy opening tabs and not independent windows in the year 202x

The first 3 scripts affect the judiciary website and the final one affects HKLII. The intention and utility of the scripts in the repo should be self-evident. If they are not, you probably only need script (3).

*NB for judiciary website, if have installed the hypothes.is + no context buttons script (2) no need to install standalone judiciary no context script (1)

*NB for HKLII:

1. be careful when clicking the "clean url" button, sometimes takes you to different judgment than the one you were just on, depending on your search path
2. if not opening judgments in new tab from search, refresh tab before "clean url" button shows up at top of page
3. if your page is zoomed in too much, button will not appear. to be safe, load page at default zoom (100%)
